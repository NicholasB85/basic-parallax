/* this is using the box model and after
some playing around I was able to make it
work but don't like the ultimate outcome.
I could have done things much differntly 
but wanted to see what I could accomplish 
without too much guidance from the internet.
found a tutorial that was ver similar to this 
but with no guidance on what they were doing and
the ultimate code they created did not work */
